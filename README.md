# Student-Management-System

INTRODUCTION

    -The Student Information Management System developed for Sichuan University aims to streamline various administrative processes using Python and SQLite. 
The system supports essential functions such as student course selection, accommodation management, book purchasing, and student information updates. 
By incorporating CRUD operations, the system ensures efficient data management and manipulation. Advanced data analysis is performed using Pandas, providing insights into student demographics, academic performance, and regional distribution, which are visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
The inclusion of a graphical user interface (GUI) further enhances the user experience, making the system more accessible and user-friendly. This project not only fulfills core requirements but also includes bonus features such as GUI development, database testing, and concurrent query handling, demonstrating a comprehensive solution for managing  student information at Sichuan University.
